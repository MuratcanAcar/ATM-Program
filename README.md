# ATM-Program
Advanced ATM Program

#### Hello, in this project, I tried to make an advanced and near-real bit ATM program. The feature of this ATM program, which I am trying to do using loops, is that it gives a warning as a result of entering the wrong password twice, as we use it in daily life, and gives a warning that your card is blocked when the wrong password is entered three times and does not continue the process. When logging in with the correct password, three operation options appear. I tested the transactions in order and corrected the missing parts according to the results. To exit the program, we can exit using the letter "Q".
